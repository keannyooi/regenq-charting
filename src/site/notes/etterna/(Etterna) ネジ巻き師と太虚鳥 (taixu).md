## Thoughts

i think i finally know what this "layering" thing is all about, no way

my main goal for the chart was to convey the same sense of emptiness as in the instrumentation, which led to trying to use as few notes as possible to represent as many instruments as possible. this, in turn, led to discovering this technique where you place notes to one instrument while following the pitch relevance of another, effectively doubling the amount of stuff the notes represent. for example in [0:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAQma8bf4mU&t=57s) the notes are charted to the piano while the PR follows the vocals, which happen to share the same notes as the piano

besides, i've also tried assigning specific sounds to specific patterns for the first time - another popular layering technique within traditional 4k charting, but perhaps made for harder charts than this (alas, i'm still plagued by skill issue). i think this technique works well for this song and sasakure.UK's compositions in general because every section is a mishmash of different instrumentation layers, if that makes sense

overall i've definitely outdone myself for this chart in terms of quality (pats back). this is a technically accurate chart that is surprisingly fun to do accuracy runs on. i may consider making a full video explaining how layering works in rhythm games for future reference - there aren't enough beginner-friendly resources for charting not by someone with decades of experience and an overestimation of the average person's comprehension of charting concepts and why they are there in the first place

oh and also a slightly altered version of this chart may or may not appear in a pack soonâ„¢
