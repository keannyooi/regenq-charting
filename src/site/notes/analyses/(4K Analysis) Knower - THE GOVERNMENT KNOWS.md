## Notes
- vocals are emphasized in measures 8 ~ 11
	- understandable since that's the main meat (haha get it) of the song
- measure 23: haha i see what you did there (literal theory)
- measure 26: the lone arrow representing the almost inaudible drum honestly feels like a layering error cuz it's the only instance within the entire section
	- same cannot be said for the buildup as it serves to amps up the intensity
	- one could argue for this layering inclusion to be postponed to measure 36, but measures 28 to 36 would feel tedious as the same layering scheme is kept so it's a matter of personal preference really
- i like how they charted the extra person saying "UNCLE SAM" on measure 70
- there seems to be some bass notes missing from the chart on measures 101 ~ 106, is it because they aren't as audible?
- final drop: breaking the layering scheme to represent 4 "THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS" samples in different volumes with visibly different amount of intensity is genius
## Morals of the Chart
- pattern assignment layering is great when the instrumentation is chaotic because the notes are grounded to something whilst embracing the chaos
- very rigid column-based keysound layering helps make speed-up / slowdown parts (e.g.: measures 115 ~ 118) easier to comprehend and time to
