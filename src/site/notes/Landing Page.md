<h2 style="text-align: center;">"hello world" - every programmer ever</h2>
Hello and welcome to this... thing! This is (hopefully) the place where I publish stuff conjured up from my obsidian notes\n
### Who are you?\n
I'm regen=Q
##### No, really, who *are* you?
A Malaysian gamedev. I've been doing gamedev-adjacent stuff for about a year and a half now (and that incidentally includes rhythm game charting)
##### Can you at least tell us how you're like as a person, outside of work-related stuff?
No, because truthfully I'm just an empty shell outside of what I do
### What should I expect from this?
I don't know for sure, but it's definitely related to gamedev in a way
### Why are you doing this?
Partially for fun, partially for future reference, 100% for some kind of self-improvement
